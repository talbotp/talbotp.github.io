<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
  Hey, I'm Parker Talbot. I am a recent graduate of both Mathematics and Computer Science, and am keen to start a career in software engineering. I have a broad range of interests in both of these fields, including data science and cryptography, and have recently been interested in systems engineering, which is something I don't know as much about but am keen to learn.
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
  I have made this website for a few reasons. Firstly, to have a bit of fun. Secondly, I am hoping to showcase some of the projects that I have been working on.
</p>

<p>
  There are pages on this website so that you can learn more <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %}">about me</a>, view <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}">projects</a>, and find out how to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link contact.md %}">contact me</a> through email/github/linkedin.
</p>
